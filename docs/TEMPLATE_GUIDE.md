- ✅ Tool calibration tracking
- ✅ Output tracking
- ✅ Approval gates

### Process Flow
```
Material Check ╲
                → Welding → QA Inspection → Pass? → Done

### Advanced Features Explained

#### 0. **Parameters vs Variables**

**Parameters (Immutable Configuration):**
- Set once at job creation
- Examples: `plateQuantity=15`, `weldingType="MIG"`, `clientPO="ABC-001"`
- Used for: Job-specific configuration that doesn't change
- Syntax: `${plateQuantity}` in step text

**Variables (Mutable Runtime State):**
- Updated during step execution
- Examples: `temperature=245`, `defectCount=2`, `passedInspection=true`
- Used for: Data that flows through pipeline stages
- Syntax: `${temperature}` in step text

**Example:**
```json
Template defines:
  "parameters": [
    {"parameterId": "plateQuantity", "label": "Plates", "defaultValue": 10}
  ],
  "variables": [
    {"variableId": "temperature", "label": "Temp (°C)", "defaultValue": 0}
  ]

Job creation: User enters plateQuantity = 15
Step execution: Operator records temperature = 245
Step text: "Weld ${plateQuantity} plates at ${temperature}°C"
Rendered: "Weld 15 plates at 245°C"
```

#### 1. **Parallel Execution**
Material check and equipment setup run simultaneously instead of sequentially, saving 30-45 minutes per job.

#### 2. **Variable Substitution (Parameters & Variables)**
Template uses `${parameterName}` and `${variableName}` which get replaced with actual values:

**Parameter substitution (set at creation):**
- Template: "Inspect ${plateQuantity} plates"
- Job with `plateQuantity=15`: "Inspect 15 plates"
- Job with `plateQuantity=50`: "Inspect 50 plates"

**Variable substitution (updated during execution):**
- Template: "Temperature recorded: ${temperature}°C"
- After step 1: "Temperature recorded: 245°C"
- After step 2: "Temperature recorded: 267°C"

**Combined usage:**
- Template: "Weld ${plateQuantity} plates using ${weldingType} at ${temperature}°C"
- Rendered: "Weld 15 plates using MIG at 245°C"
  - `plateQuantity` and `weldingType` are parameters (set at job creation)
  - `temperature` is a variable (updated during execution)

#### 4. **Conditional Stages**
Rework stage only runs if QA fails:
```javascript
"condition": "failed()"  // Only execute if previous stage failed
```

Cleanup always runs regardless:
```javascript
"condition": "always()"  // Execute no matter what
```

#### 5. **Typed Requirements**
Instead of text "Need welder cert":
```json
{
  "requirementType": "qualification",
  "certificationId": "AWS_D1.1",
  "expirationCheck": true
}
```
System automatically:
- Checks if user has certification
- Validates expiration date
- Blocks step if not qualified

#### 6. **Output Tracking**
Welding step produces:
- Physical artifact (welded assembly)
- Temperature data (for analysis)
- Documentation (welding log)

These outputs are tracked and passed to inspection step.
